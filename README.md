# ESPHome based Circulation Pump Controller

This project describes how to build a Circulation Pump Controller using ESPHome and controlled from Home Assistant.  For my purpose, I have a hot water circulation pump that I use for instant hot water at my farthest facuet in the house.

The yellow line is the return PEX loop that I installed.  It runs through the attic and back to the water heater in the garage.
