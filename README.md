# ESPHome based Circulation Pump Controller

This project describes how to build a Circulation Pump Controller using ESPHome and thats controlled from Home Assistant.  For me, I use it to control a hot water circulation pump and valve that I installed near my water heater in the garage.

## What is a Hot Water Circulation Pump:

A hot water circulation pump is a device used in plumbing systems to circulate hot water from a water heater to the various fixtures and appliances in a building. This can include things like sinks, showers, and bathtubs. The pump is typically installed in the hot water line, and its purpose is to ensure that hot water is readily available to all fixtures and appliances, without the need to wait for the water to be heated. This can save energy and reduce the wait time for hot water. This system uses a ESP32 with ESPHome and Home Assistant to control when the pump is active, further increasing energy efficiency.
